                    <p>ZZ Black is the story about a motherless, young girl who lives on a horse farm and despite the numerous horses in her father’s care, is determined to find a young horse she can nurture and train.</p>
                    <p>When a deeply traumatized colt arrives at the farm, she falls in love with his wounded soul and devotes herself to healing his fractured spirit. The colt, whom she names ZZ Black, responds to her seemingly magical, soothing touch and for the first time in his young life, begins to trust a human being.</p>
                    <p>Their promising relationship is transformative for both of them. Kate experiences the joy of ZZ Black’s unconditional love. ZZ Black blooms in her constant care and kindness. Still, her father worries that she may be neglecting her studies and is entirely too distracted by the horse. In order to abate his concerns, Kate assures him that once Black is broken, she will resume her regular chores and apply herself to her studies. Her father gives her a deadline and Kate knows that she and ZZ must make good on her promise. Kate enjoys a fantastical relationship with several of the farm inhabitants with whom she shares her greatest fears and ambitions. Chief among these confidants is her beautiful yellow lab, Pebbles, who is her constant companion and protector.</p>
                    <p>As ZZ Black matures into a stronger horse, the time comes for him to be broken, saddled and ridden like all the other horses on the farm. This proves to be a turning point for both of them and the question arises: will Kate’s love for ZZ Black be enough to help him overcome his fear of men and transition to a tamed steed? During this process, an event takes place that invokes one of ZZ’s most terrifying memories and he, in abject fear, behaves so badly, he nearly kills one of the farmhands. Kate’s father knows that this horse will never be manageable and issues a final edict. Faced with the grim news, Kate must choose between her love for ZZ or a future without him.</p>
