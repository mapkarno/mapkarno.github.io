                    <p>Elisabeth Anisimow is an nine-year old painting prodigy. A native Californian of Russian descent, she  has amassed a body of work numbering nearly seventy paintings which she began at the tender age of two. Since then, she has won countless international art contests and her work is on display at The Children’s Art Museum in Oslo, Norway.</p>
                    <p>When asked why she paints, Elisabeth replies: “It makes me feel good to paint what is running around in my head.”  Her current favorite painting is of a protective angel flying high above a city protecting the residents below.</p>
                    <p>Elisabeth is a third grade student in Pacific Palisades, California where she is also a bit of a tomboy who enjoys climbing trees with her best friend and next door neighbor.  She is a voracious reader who consumes countless books about fine art. Picasso, Van Gogh, and Da Vinci – whose masterpiece, The Mona Lisa, is her greatest inspiration.</p>
                    <p>Elisabeth’s colorful personality coupled with her magical imagination is what separates her from the conventional 9 year old, she paints what she sees which reaches far beyond a world of the ordinary.</p>

                    <p>Wendy Plumb is a single, working mom who lives in Pacific Palisades, CA. Her greatest passion in life is caring for her eight year-old daughter, Vienna, a golden-haired darling with a myriad of interests and talents.  Wendy’s personal history is rife with adventure and self-discovery. Married in her twenties, Wendy lived abroad in Monaco and Paris for over a decade until she missed her family and life in Southern California.  She elected to return to a much simpler life in Topanga Canyon, where she pursued a professional life as an accredited yoga instructor.</p>
                    <p>Always looking inward for inspiration and eschewing materialism, Wendy sought new challenges and responsibilities in her mid-thirties which led her to have a child on her own. This decision turned into a full-time role for Wendy which left spare time to support her partnership in a beloved boutique, The Cottage, which she co-manages with her mother, Virginia.
                    <p>After contemplating her journey on the planet well into forties, Wendy embarked on a career as a life coach receiving her certification from the University of Spiritual Psychology. These few years of study and work propelled her in a new direction as a writer, a natural segue for someone who has always sought greater understanding of the world around her and to help those who are suffering.  Wendy’s first project is a children’s book which underscores the themes of unconditional love, co-dependency and letting go. As a mother, she couldn’t think of a better gift for her daughter than communicating valuable lessons through an engaging story designed to educate and entertain.</p>
                    <p>This will be the first of many children’s projects Wendy will undertake as her own daughter navigates her way through childhood and adolescence on her way to becoming a responsible, compassionate and intelligent young adult.</p>
                    <p>“I always felt that the struggles are well worth it, if the pain had a chance to give back”</p>
